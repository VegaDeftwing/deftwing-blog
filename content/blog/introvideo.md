Well, I guess I'm offically a YouTuber now. I guess I should introduce myself a bit: I'm Vega, a Computer and Electrical
engineering major at UNL. I enjoy all the things you can see in the intro video above as well as skateboarding, gaming, and
hanging out with cool people. I tend to do a lot of strange, one-off projects and I'd like to share some of them with you, so
that's why I made the blog and YouTube channel. I'll be posting more later, I just wanted to get this up and running for now.

also, I Just finished the rough edges around this blog theme, will be posting it to github soon.
