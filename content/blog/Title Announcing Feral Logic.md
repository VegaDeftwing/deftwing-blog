A few friends of mine with similar interests are staring a group that all of our channels, social media, and what not will be under so that all of you can find even more great content. For now this group will only be Vordex and I, but soon there should be more of us. We're really looking forward to getting to know all of you and sharing our accrued knowledge of everything tech. Without further ado, I'll give the proverbial mic to Vordex.

> Hello! My name is Vordex and I'm the guy behind the YouTube channel "RomLabs". Technology and the Maker Movement have been huge passions of mine. It's still amazes me what we can accomplish and how quick technology advances. Part of my goal with RomLabs is to inspire others to get outside their comfort zone and go make things! YouTube and the open sharing of information has allowed me to learn so much, so I'm looking forward to the chance to give back! I'm also heavily involved with the FIRST Robotics Competition. Itâ€™s a Highschool robotics competition where students have 6 weeks to design and build a full sized robot to preform various tasks in a yearly game. Its amazing to see what these students can come up with and I encourage everyone to look into it!
